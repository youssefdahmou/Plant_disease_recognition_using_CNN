Project Title: Plant Disease Recognition Using CNN

Description: In this project, I have developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of detecting and categorizing plant diseases. Within this repository, you will find the complete code in the training folder, and the trained model is stored in a directory named 'models'.

To utilize this project, follow the steps below:

    1- Clone the project:
        bash
        Copy code
            git clone https://github.com/youssefdahmou/Plant_disease_recognition_using_CNN.git
    2- Train the model on your customized data:

        Navigate to the training folder, then access the PlantVillage directory.
        Paste your data into this folder, paying attention to the data structure.
        Retrain the model and save it.

    3- Proceed to the 'models' folder, where your trained model is now ready for use.
